# Big-Game-Census-Analytics

I am done this project as a Data Scientist Intern at Unified Mentor Pvt. Ltd.

Technology:- Data Science 

Domain:- Sports

Tools:- Python(Jupiter Notebook), Microsoft PowerBI, Microsoft PowerPoint, and Microsoft Excel

Problem Statement:-
This Big Game Census data visualization takes a fun look at where Super Bowl 52 players come from, the related population figures, and opens up pathways (via embedded links) to additional census data points.  The dataset came about when two hapless data nerds had their teams eliminated from the playoffs, thus turning to data to try to find more rooting interests for Super Bowl 52. The rosters for both, competing teams are included, with the corresponding roster information and birthplace and state population information. The developers utilized census data pulled from census.gov, and roster information from Yahoo Sports, and designed the data visualization within the Tableau platform. Identify fun facts you've found within this data and/or data visualization, and has that swayed your rooting interest in the game?
